    <h2>Help with writing my first page</h2>
    <p>Hello!

        I read somewhere it is better to get guidance from more experienced editors to help with writing a first Wikipedia page.
        
        So here I am...
        
        All tips and help, gratefully received.

    <h2>Emails from an LTA</h2>
    <p>A few years ago in 2020, I used to receive emails from an LTA.
         They have now resumed their emails. I havenâ€™t been responding to their emails ever since. 
         I have reported the email address to Google. Since then, I have set aside another email 
         to use for Wikipedia matters. They are sending them to my personal email.
          I was wondering if there is anything that I, the WMF, or Google can do to stop the emails 
          from the LTA. I can send you a copy of their email if you need it.
