        Some <b><em>Indian writers</em></b> and <b><em>archaeologists</em></b> have opposed the notion of a 
        migration of Indo-Aryans into India, and argued for an indigenous origin 
        of the Indo-Aryans.[16][17] In this view, "the <i>Indian</i> civilization must be 
        viewed as an unbroken tradition that goes back to the earliest period of the 
        Sindhu-Sarasvati (or Indus) tradition (7000 or 8000 BCE)."[18] Though popular in India, 
        and reflecting Indian views on Indian history and religion,[19] the idea of a purely 
        indigenous origin of the Indo-Aryans is outside the academic mainstream
